This project generates a logo in SVG format based on user input for the text, text color, and shape. It uses Node.js, inquirer, and fs modules, and also requires a shapes.js file that contains the Circle, Triangle, and Square classes.

## Getting Started

To use this project, you should first clone the repository and install the dependencies using: `npm instal`.

Then, run the project using the following command: `node index.js`

This will prompt the user to enter up to 3 characters, a text color, a shape (circle, triangle, or square), and a shape color. The project will generate an SVG logo with the specified text and shape, and save it as logo.svg in the examples directory.

## Usage

This project can be used to generate logos for personal or commercial use. However, please note that the shapes and colors used in the logo may be subject to copyright or trademark laws, so it is your responsibility to ensure that your logo does not infringe on any existing rights.
